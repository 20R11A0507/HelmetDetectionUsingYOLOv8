# HelmetDetectionUsingYOLOv8
This project is a naive implementation of the object detection which is done using YOLOv8 under the Ultralytics Platform.

#Methods of Execution
##To train the Model
Training a model is a very simple task in the Ultralytics package but creating a custom dataset is a time demanding process.
To create the dataset we take the **_2wheelerTrafficWOHelmet.webm_** and extract the first **_N_** frames.
